<p align="center">Hello, I'm xWand! I am a secondary school student studying Computer Science and Music Technology. I began my coding adventure a long time, my first ever experiences being making Snake in Python. Now, I've moved onto Java and other popular languages to develop various softwares such as Minecraft addons. Some of which include: anticheats, server cores, punishment systems, ranking systems, and public plugin addons. Aside from Minecraft, I've developed a few websites in Python, and experimented with JDA for Discord Bots.</p>
