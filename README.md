### Hello!

Hello, I'm xWand! I am a secondary school student studying Computer Science and Music Technology. I've been creating Minecraft plugins since 2019 and have had experience in working in different areas. Some of which include: anticheats, server cores, punishment systems, ranking systems, and public plugin addons. Aside from Minecraft, I've developed a few websites in Python (ew), and experimented with JDA for Discord Bots.
